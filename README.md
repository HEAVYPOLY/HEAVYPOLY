# HANNAH_Blender

An adapted workflow for Blender 4.1 for tablet users and left handed people. (Also friendly for right handed people)\
**IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU KNOW THE DEFAULT KEYMAP OF BLENDER AND ARE USED TO A PIE MENU WORKFLOW, THIS OVERHAUL IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS**

I have been using the [HEAVYPOLY_BLENDER](https://github.com/HEAVYPOLY/HEAVYPOLY_Blender) setup since 2020.\
In 2022 I have started out doing a few PRs to optimize it for later blender versions. Down the line I started deleting scripts inside it that I didn't use.

The reason why I keep using this setup is because my right hand under the default keymapping of Blender, suffers from repetitive stress.
The goal is to keep this overhaul as easy of an experience from this to Vanilla as you can get.


Install Instructions:
1. Install a **fresh** version of Blender, preferably as a portable version if your OS allows it.
2. Start up Blender once.
3. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/HannahFantasia/HANNAH_Blender/releases) and download the latest version `.zip`
4. Open your Blender installation folder.
5. Click on the version folder, could be something like `4.1`
6. Drop the contents of the `release.zip` inside the version folder.
7. Open Blender inside the installation folder and You're done ;)
